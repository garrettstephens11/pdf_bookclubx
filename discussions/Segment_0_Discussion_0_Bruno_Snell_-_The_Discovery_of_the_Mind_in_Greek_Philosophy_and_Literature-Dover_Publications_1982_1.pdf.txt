Person A: The phrase "the intellect was not 'invented', as a man would invent a tool" stands out to me. It suggests that intellect isn't something that was created to serve a specific purpose. It brings to mind how unexpectedly complex and significant the human intellect is. Relating it back to the passage, it points to the unique approach the Greeks had, treating the discovery of the human mind as an unearthing of a pre-existing entity rather than a creation of a new concept.

Person B: One phrase that jumps out at me is â€œthey discovered the human mind". It brings to my mind the idea of exploration and uncovering something that, as significantly large as it may seem, had been overlooked or undiscovered. In the context of the passage, it signifies the idea that the Greeks were the first to seriously explore and analyze the concept of the human intellect.

Person C: I'm fascinated by the term 'self-revelation' in the passage. It brings to mind how the Greeks must have begun to understand their own consciousness and thinking processes, almost as if looking inwardly at themselves. This ties back to the broader theme of the book, which seems to centre on the Greek discovery and exploration of human intellect.

Person A: That's a nice perspective, Person C. That word also stood out to me. 'Self-revelation' suggests an unveiling of one's identity or nature to one's own self. I suppose it ties back to the awakening of the early Greeks to their intellectual capabilities and potential.

Person B: I like what you both said about 'self-revelation'. To me, it also implies a process that is inherently individual and personal. It's like the Greeks initiated a journey inward that continues to this day as we keep on discovering new dimensions of our minds and consciousness 

Person C: Yes, indeed. That's the beauty contained in the phrase 'self-revelation'. It speaks not only of the awakening of human intellect during the epoch of the Greeks, but also subtly hints at the ongoing process of self-discovery that each one of us undertakes in our lives. It certainly connects with the passage as it talks about the discovery of human intellect as more of a revelation - an unfolding mystery - rather than an invention.
