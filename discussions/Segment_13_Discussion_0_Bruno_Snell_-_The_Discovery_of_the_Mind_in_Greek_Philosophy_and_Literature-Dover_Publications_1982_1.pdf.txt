**Person A:** I found the phrase "wretched I lie, unsouled by desire" really striking. It's such a vivid description of being overwhelmed by emotion. It reminds me of times when love or any intense feeling just consumes you, making you feel almost detached from your own existence. In the passage, Archilochus uses this to contrast the external grandeur and pomp that he rejects, highlighting instead the raw, often painful, inner experiences that define our humanity.

**Person B:** That's a good point, A. For me, the phrase "the rough man-at-arms" stood out. It brings to mind the image of a soldier who's more about substance than style, which Archilochus seems to value. It's like he's saying that true worth isn't about how you look or how you're perceived, but what you're made of inside. This ties into the broader theme of the passage where appearance is critiqued against inner merit.

**Person C:** I was intrigued by the word "Cimmerian." It's not just a random adjective; it evokes this dark, mysterious aura. The Cimmerians in mythology are associated with darkness and the unknown, which for me, parallels the hidden, true nature of Artemon, who went from rags to riches. It's a clever way to foreshadow the revelation of his past, tying back to Anacreon's critique of superficial appearances versus genuine reality.

**Person A:** Absolutely, C. The use of "Cimmerian" also adds a layer of depth to the narrative. It's like Anacreon is using this term to imply that Artemon's rise to prominence has obscured his true, perhaps ignoble origins. It's a critique of how society often elevates people based on superficial attributes rather than genuine merit or character, which echoes the passage's focus on the disconnect between external show and internal substance.

**Person B:** And the discussion about Archilochus's shield really brings this home. When he says, "What is a shield to me? My life is worth more," it's almost like he's stripping away the veneer of honor and duty to reveal a raw, survivalist perspective. This directly challenges traditional values, suggesting a critique of how war and heroism are glorified at the expense of human life.

**Person C:** Yes, B, and it's interesting how these poets, through their choice of words and themes, are essentially questioning societal norms and values. They're not just describing their feelings but using these descriptions to challenge the audience's perceptions. It's like they're saying, "Look beyond the surface, there's more to life than what's celebrated in public."
