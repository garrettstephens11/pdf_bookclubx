**Person A:** The phrase that stood out to me was "community of thought and feeling." It's fascinating how Sappho envisions a connection not bound by physical presence but through shared memories and emotions. This resonates with me because in our modern era, with technology, we're constantly connected yet often feel isolated. Sappho's idea suggests that true companionship transcends physical space, which feels very relevant today.

**Person B:** I noticed the word "jealousy" mentioned in relation to Atthis. It's intriguing because it adds a layer of complexity to Sappho's feelings, showing not just love but also the pain and conflict within love. This makes me think about how human emotions are often a mix of contradictory feelings, which Sappho captures beautifully. It relates to the passage's message about the depth of personal experience and how these emotions connect us across distances.

**Person C:** For me, the phrase "pure reflexion that memory is but an evocation of past beauty" was striking. It encapsulates how Sappho uses memory not just as a tool for nostalgia but as a means to preserve beauty and love. This reminds me of how we often use memories to cope with loss or separation, similar to how Sappho and her companions use it to maintain their bond. It's a poignant reminder that while people might leave, the beauty of what was shared remains, echoing the theme of unity through memory.

**Person A:** Building on what Person C mentioned, the evocation of past beauty through memory also serves as a bridge between Sappho's time and ours. It's a timeless concept, suggesting that our experiences and the beauty we perceive have a lasting impact, influencing not only our own lives but also how we relate to others over time and space.

**Person B:** Exactly, Person A. And to add to that, the 'jealousy' aspect also points to the humanization of these legendary figures. It makes them relatable, not just as characters from myths but as real people with real emotions, which I find incredibly grounding in literature.

**Person C:** Yes, and considering the broader context of the passage, where Sappho discusses the evolution of human understanding of the soul, these personal reflections on memory, love, and jealousy illustrate a shift in how people began to perceive their inner lives. It's like Sappho is not just sharing her personal experiences but also contributing to a cultural shift in understanding individuality and community.
