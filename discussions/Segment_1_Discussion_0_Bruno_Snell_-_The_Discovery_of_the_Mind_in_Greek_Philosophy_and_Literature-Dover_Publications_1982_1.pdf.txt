**Person A:** The phrase "vital experiences" really caught my attention. It makes me think of the raw, unfiltered moments of realization or understanding that shape us fundamentally. In the context of this passage, it seems to refer to how the Greeks' intellectual discoveries were not just academic but deeply personal and transformative. It's like their understanding of the intellect and soul wasn't just theoretical; it was something they lived through, which in turn, laid the groundwork for European philosophy and culture.

**Person B:** That's an interesting point, A. For me, the word "gaps" stood out. It evokes the idea of missing pieces in a puzzle, which in this text refers to elements of thought or knowledge that were absent in Homer's time. It reminds me of how we often look back at historical or cultural texts to understand what was not known or valued then, which helps us appreciate the evolution of thought. This approach of looking at what's missing can actually tell us a lot about what was known or understood implicitly or explicitly.

**Person C:** Yes, B, the gaps are fascinating. I was struck by the term "historical setting." This phrase brings to mind the idea that every intellectual or cultural development doesn't occur in a vacuum but is deeply embedded in the context of its time. The passage suggests that understanding the Greeks' contributions requires us to see them not as isolated achievements but as responses to their historical, social, and cultural environment. It's like saying, to understand the significance of their thought, we need to understand the world they lived in.

**Person A:** Absolutely, C. And thinking about these terms in relation to 'tertium comparationes,' it seems like the passage is inviting us to compare not just the content of Greek thought with our own, but the very process of how thought evolves. The "gaps" could be seen as a tertium comparationis for understanding not just what was known but how knowledge itself was formed and perceived across different epochs.

**Person B:** That's a great way to look at it, A. Using "vital experiences" as a tertium, we can compare the personal, transformative experiences of learning or realization between now and then. It's like saying, what we consider 'vital' or life-changing in our intellectual journey might have parallels in ancient Greek thought, even if the subjects are different.

**Person C:** And with "historical setting" as a comparison point, we're looking at how the environment shapes thought. This could be a way to compare how modern intellectual developments are influenced by our current societal structures, technologies, and cultural norms versus those of ancient Greece. It's a reminder that intellectual history is also a history of context.
