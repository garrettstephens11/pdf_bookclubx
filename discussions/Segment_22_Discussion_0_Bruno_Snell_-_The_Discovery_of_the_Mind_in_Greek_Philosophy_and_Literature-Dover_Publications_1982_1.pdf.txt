Person A: The phrase "effulgence of the divine" really caught my attention. It evokes a sense of radiant and glowing divinity, almost like a shining light or brilliance that encompasses everything.

Person B: I agree, the phrase "effulgence of the divine" paints a vivid picture of the transcendent and awe-inspiring nature of the divine presence. It brings to mind a sense of overwhelming beauty and splendor that is beyond our immediate comprehension.

Person C: For me, the word "stately eloquence" stood out. It conveys a sense of grace, dignity, and grandeur in how Pindar expresses his thoughts and praises. This phrase brings to mind the idea of conveying profound ideas with elegance and sophistication, reflecting a deep respect for the subject matter being discussed in the passage.
