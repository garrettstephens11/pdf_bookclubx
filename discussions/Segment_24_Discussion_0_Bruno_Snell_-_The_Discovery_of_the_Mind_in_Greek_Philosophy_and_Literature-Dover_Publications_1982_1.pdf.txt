Person A: One phrase that really stood out to me was "mythical reality." It reminds me of our inherent need to seek meaning or find significance in events or stories that surpass the present narrative. When it comes to the passage, it seems to be pointing out how art and storytelling serve to recreate this mythical reality, imbuing current situations with a deeper significance.

Person B: I found the concept of "free exercise of the imagination" to be striking. It conjures up a sense of liberation and creativity untethered by any constraints. This ties back to the textâ€™s exploration of how art, specifically drama, can diverge from truth and still provide a meaningful experience that possibly outruns the 'reality' itself.

Person C: For me, the term "appropriate" or "commensurate with" reality stood out. It pulls my mind towards the idea of different degrees of realism. The idea that art should uphold some relation to reality, but not necessarily an exact imitation. In the text, this seems to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the boundary between truth and fiction in art.

Person A: Picking up on that, the description of art as a "different sort of reality" relates. Art exudes its own reality, mythological in essence yet, distanced from the immediate reality. Instead of being strict representations of what is, art transforms into a conduit for what could be - a suggestion, a possibility, or a reimagining.

Person B: Exactly, and if we draw upon the phrase I initially highlighted, "free exercise of the imagination," it all comes together. Art, such as drama, provides a platform to explore 'what-ifs', and by doing so, it manifests a reality that surpasses the ordinary, creating a mythical or symbolic significance that ordinary reality might lack.

Person C: To bring my initial phrase, "appropriate" or "commensurate with" reality, back into play - the aim of art, then, seems not to replicate reality strictly but to interpret and amplify it. In the end, that gives the audience a more profound insight, making them question their understanding and perception of reality itself.
