**Person A:** One quote that stood out to me was: "It must not be thought, however, that the pictures of human beings from the time of Homer are like the primitive drawings to which our children have accustomed us, though they too simply add limb to limb." I found it fascinating because it made me picture how early Greek art lacked unity and treated the body as a collection of parts. It reminds me of how language and visual understanding evolve together—and in this passage, it's as if early Greek art was a reflection of their segmented conceptualization of the "body."

**Person B:** That’s a great pick! For me, the quote that stood out was: "Of course the Homeric man had a body exactly like the later Greeks, but he did not know it qua body, but merely as the sum total of his limbs." It made me think about how we take for granted that modern concepts, like "body," have always existed, when in reality, the Greeks were still building their understanding of such an idea. Relating to the broader message, it highlights how language shapes thought and reveals the gradual process of conceptualizing human anatomy and identity.

**Person C:** I was struck by the line: "The psyche which is the prize of battle, which is risked, and saved, is identical with the soul which departs from a dying man." It made me think about how ancient ideas of the "soul," especially the way it intertwines with life and breath, seem fluid compared to our modern distinctions between body, mind, and soul. In the context of this passage, it shows how Homeric language reflects a fragmented understanding of human experience—focusing on pieces of physical or emotional phenomena, rather than a unified self.

**Person A:** That’s a good point, C—it's almost like the psyche wasn’t an "inner" self yet; it was more of a vital force tied to survival. It makes me think about how even today we talk about "losing your breath" as a metaphor for losing control or life itself. This passage seems to suggest that these ideas about the psyche's functions evolved alongside language, becoming more abstract over time.

**Person B:** That’s such an interesting take! A’s earlier comment about art resonates here too—it’s like the Greeks were physically sketching out their conceptualizations of the body and soul, just as they were linguistically trying to name them. I think the broader point being highlighted here is how language and expression often lag behind inner comprehension, leaving culture to catch up over time.

**Person C:** Absolutely, and what struck me is how the Greeks didn’t initially see what we think of today as a "whole." Whether in their art or in Homer’s words, there’s this lack of integration that parallels their fragmented description of limbs. That gives a lot of weight to the passage's message about the limits of their understanding—they couldn’t yet define a cohesive "body" or "soul" because they hadn’t yet thought to look for that unity.
