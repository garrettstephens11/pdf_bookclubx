Person A: The phrase "the thymos left his bones" really caught my attention. It made me think about the idea of departure and separation, especially in the context of death. It brings to mind the concept of the soul or essence of a person leaving behind their physical body.

Person B: I agree, the imagery of the thymos departing from the limbs and bones is quite powerful. It made me reflect on the notion of the body being just a vessel for something more ethereal or spiritual. The word "thymos" itself stood out to me, as it seems to encompass emotions, motion, and perhaps even life force.

Person C: I was intrigued by the discussion on the distinction between thymos, noos, and psyche. It made me ponder on the complexities of the mind and the different aspects that make up a person's being. The comparison between thymos as the organ of motion and noos as the organ of understanding was thought-provoking, reminding me of the intricate interconnectedness of our thoughts, emotions, and actions.
